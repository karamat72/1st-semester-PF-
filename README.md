Programming is the process of giving instructions to a computer so it can perform tasks. These instructions are written in a programming language (like Python, Java, C++, etc.).  A computer doesn’t “think” — it follows your instructions exactly. So learning to program means learning how to break problems down into steps a computer can understand.
